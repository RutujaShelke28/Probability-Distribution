# Probability-Distribution
This project focuses on understanding and analyzing different probability distributions using Python. The objective is to study how data behaves under various probability distribution models and to visualize their characteristics through graphical representations.

The project implements common probability distributions such as Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Uniform distributions using Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. Random data is generated or real datasets are used to observe distribution patterns, calculate statistical measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation, and compare theoretical distributions with actual data.

Data visualization plays a key role in this project, helping to interpret probability density functions (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF). These visual insights make it easier to understand real-world uncertainty and randomness in data.

This project is useful for building a strong foundation in statistics and probability, which are essential concepts in data science, machine learning, and analytics.
